## Introduction

This sprint was dedicated to learning (Goal), and we put so much effort on tutorials and studying.

Most of the issues was about reading documents. After reading the required documents and watching tutorials, each member had to implement or review a related project to their framework.

The evaluation of the learning (Definition of Done, Acceptance Criteria) are by the presentation and projects each member had. All the DoDs and ACs were met and the sprint Goals were achieved.

## Completed Stories

Fortunately, all the stories were completed in this sprint. 

## Work Logs

All the work logs can be observed from sub-tasks of each story. The total work log statistics is shown bellow.

Note: Work logs are a little bit off which is discussed in [Things can bo done better in the next sprints](#things-can-be-done-better-in-the-next-sprints) section. 

## Things can be done better in the next sprints

Issues in this sprint were mainly solo, and hence, the cooperation rate was a little bit short. One of the goals for next sprints is that we can collaborate more and have more shared tasks with each other, although the taks of this sprint were solitude inherently.

Work logs was not so accurate, and we should be more careful about it. We should also be more careful about the time estimation of the tasks.

## Lessons Learned
We learned to log the working time when we are done with the task and do not delay it for an another time. 

We also learned to distribute tasks in the sprint evenly and not do all of them at the end of the sprint.
