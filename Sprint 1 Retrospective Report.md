# Sprint 1 Retrospective Report

## Discussing The Sprint

This sprint was dedicated to learning (Goal), and we put so much effort on tutorials and studying.

Most of the issues was about reading documents. After reading the required documents and watching tutorials, each member had to implement or review a related project to their framework.

All the members spent enough time on the learning and after that, they presented a small project with their project

The evaluation of the learning (Definition of Done, Acceptance Criteria) are by the presentation and projects each member had. All the DoDs and ACs were met and the sprint Goals were achieved.

Below, you can see some sample tasks, the contributions and time capacities.


## Things can be done better in the next sprints

Issues in this sprint were mainly solo, and hence, the cooperation rate was a little bit short. One of the goals for next sprints is that we can collaborate more and have more shared tasks with each other, although the taks of this sprint were solitude inherently.
