## Introduction
In this sprint we designed and implemented the main features of library. Besides that, we achieved complete and correct implementation of user handeling.

The evaluation of implementation (Definition of Done, Acceptance Criteria) are by the tests and code review each member had. All the DoDs and ACs were met and the sprint Goals were achieved.

The only change we made to the project was the change of the database. First we planned to set up a PostgreSQL, but through the sprint we came into conclusion that SQLite would be better suited for the project and we changed our plan.

## Completed Stories
Fortunately, all the stories were completed in this sprint.

## Work Logs
All the work logs can be observed from sub-tasks of each story. The total work log statistics is shown bellow.

## Things can be done better in the next sprints
Planning can be improved if we think more about detailes of the implementation. So, we try to increase time of planning session in the next sprint to lessen the probabilty of plan changing.

## Lessons Learned
We should dedicate more time on the planning, since we changed our database from PostgeSQL to SQLite.
