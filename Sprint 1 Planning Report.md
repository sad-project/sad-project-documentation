## Introduction
In the first stage we planned how to contribute to the project and we decided which members develop each aspect of the project.

The project consists of three main parts:
* Front-end
* Back-end
* Infrastructure

In the planning stage, members chose parts to contribute, and accordingly, in the next stage of the sprint, members started to learn and review the concepts to be able to work with the required frameworks.
