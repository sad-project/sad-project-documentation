## Introduction

After we learned the required framework and prepared ourselves for the project, now we have to start coding.

First thing first, we want to develop the user model and accordingly, we develop login/register page.
User model only requires back-end development, but the login/register developments must be done on both front and beck ends.
Besides that, we believe that another progress that should be obtained by the end of this sprint is to define and develop library models, pages, classes and functions.
Therefore, we created 6 issues, all of which are related to the mentioned developments.
Below, you can see the issues and samples of some subtasks.

Parameters of Goals, Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria are defined in the description of each task and we are supposed to meet all the requirements by the
end of the sprint.
